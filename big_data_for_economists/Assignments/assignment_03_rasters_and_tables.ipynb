However, some cases will require you to search the internet for answers. This is intended because efficiently searching documentation or Stackoverflow is a requirement of modern programing. This assignment also requires you to obtain data (I will tell you where) and organize it correctly so that you can access is via relative paths (do not use absolute paths anywhere in this assignment).\n",

Specifically, you will use data from a global, 300m resolution land-use, land-cover (LULC) map produced by ESACCI. They provide a wonderful time series of data from 1992-2019. If you want more information, check out their web viewer at https://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/. Here you can view the data but also learn more about the classification regressions that uses time-series spectral data patterns to classify grid-cells into different types.
