This course strongly recommends that you bring your own laptop because having a well-setup laptop will serve you well into your academic career. If this is not possible, please contact the instructors within the first week of class and we can discuss alternatives.  It is possible to use a PC, Mac or Linux for this course, though all examples will be given on a PC.  Becoming skilled in Big Data is partly about mastering the tools and it will be your responsibility to come to class with your computer setup in a way for you to succeed. We will discuss any setup steps necessary in the lecture before it is to be used.\n",
