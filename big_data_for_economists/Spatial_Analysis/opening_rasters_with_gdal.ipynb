This means that if you don't tell numpy to make a copy of something, any new variable will point to the old array. More specifically, this only creates a new pointer to the same block of memory on your computer that holds the array. If we change c_view, c will also be changed. So in the below, c_view only points to the old data in c. This is called a \"view\" of the array."
